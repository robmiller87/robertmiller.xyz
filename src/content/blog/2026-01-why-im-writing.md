I've been circling around the idea of writing publicly for a while now. Not to build an audience or establish expertise — just to think more clearly.

Writing forces a certain discipline. Half-formed ideas that feel solid in your head tend to fall apart when you try to put them into words. The act of writing is really the act of thinking, slowed down enough that you can see where the gaps are.

This site is for that. A place to work through ideas about technology, markets, systems — the things I spend most of my time thinking about anyway. Some of it will be technical. Some of it will be more speculative. None of it is meant to be definitive.

I'm drawn to questions that sit at the intersection of how things work and why they work that way. Why certain technologies succeed while others don't. How incentives shape systems. What patterns recur across different domains.

The format will be loose. Short observations when something strikes me. Longer pieces when I need to work through something more carefully. The occasional link to something worth reading.

If any of this resonates, welcome. If not, that's fine too. I'm mostly writing for myself — but I've found that the best thinking often happens in public, where ideas can be challenged and refined.

Let's see where this goes.
