description: "Robert Miller. Writing about technology, markets, and systems."
---

I'm Robert Miller.

This site is a place for me to think out loud — working through ideas about technology, markets, systems, and whatever else holds my attention.

I believe in clear thinking over clever writing, and in showing your work rather than just your conclusions. Most of what I write here is exploratory rather than authoritative.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me at [robert@robertmillerconsultancy.com](mailto:robert@robertmillerconsultancy.com).
